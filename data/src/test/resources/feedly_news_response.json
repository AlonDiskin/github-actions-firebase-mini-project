In 2022, the company signed <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/14/23167555/apple-tv-mls-live-sports-streaming\">a 10-year deal</a> for streaming rights to Major League Soccer, which <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/27/23810301/lionel-messi-viewers-mls-apple-tv\">got a big boost a year later with Lionel Messi’s arrival in Miami</a>.
